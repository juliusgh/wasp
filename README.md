The Workbench Analysis Sequence Processor (WASP) is a project intended to facilitate a consistence interface for processing analysis sequence ascii data. It is intended to preserve the entire ascii data format supported by the implemented processors. This preservation is important for programmatically accessing the data and tracking the data's textual location for interactive communication to the user.

The is a Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation (NEAMS) Workbench collaboration project.
