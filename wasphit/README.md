# Hierarchical Input Text - HIT
The Hierarchical input text provides an input syntax used by the MOOSE framework

## Input Syntax
The syntax pattern is as follows:

```
file := block*|key*|file_include*
block := '[' name ']' block_members '[]'
block_members := (block_member | file_include)*
block_member := block | key_value
file_include := 'include' string
key_value := name '=' value
name := string
value := (number|string|array)
array := "'" (number|string) "'"
```
where the block `name` must adhere to the pattern `([A-Za-z0-9_\.])+`. A `value` can be an integer, real, string, or array (as indicated by single quotes).
A file can have zero or more blocks and arbritrarily include files. 

An example is as follows:
```
# Comments look like this
[block_name1]
   # keys have optional '=' 
   name = 1
   name = 3.14159
   name = "string value"
   
   array 1 2 3 4
   
[block2] 
   command 1.2 1 2 3 3 4
       command_key1 "value"
           command_key2 = 2.71
[block3]
  # command with sections
  name 1 2 3 / a b c / 4.0 5.0
```

The above example illustrates arbitrary hierarchy. 

Note that the block indentation is recommended for clarity but is not required.

If a collision occurs between a command value and name, the command value must be quoted to disambiguate it.

```
[block_name1]
  command1 string
  command2_named_string 
```
must be 


```
[block_name1]
  command1 'string'
  command2_named_string 
```

## Extra Definition Driven
In order to annotate the generated parse tree the interpreter takes instruction from the 
input schema, and the extra definition constructs are embedded in the `InputAliases` array
of the input field. Examples follow.

### Named fields
The EDDI logic recognizes the `_name` child component as a special identifier of the object.
All subsequent aliasing constructs (index, section, strided) will be adjusted. E.g., child indexing will be displaced such that the name/identifier will not be annotated by indexing/stride/section aliasing.

### Index-based field naming
Indexed fields are aliased using the '_INDEX' where INDEX is zero-based index into the non-decorative list of child nodes.

```
% Example of data object with x and y children at index 0,1 
data{ 
   x{InputAliases['_0']} 
   y{InputAliases['_1']}
}
```
Note: Subsequent indexing will receive the generic `value` child name instea of `x` or `y`.

### Strided field naming
Strided field naming allows for creating tuples of data given an arbitrary list of data.
The Strides must be equal so as to avoid ambiguous aliasing.
```
% Example of x, y, z tuple. User can provide as many x,y,z tupes
data {
  x{InputAliases[STRIDE[0,3]]}
  y{InputAliases[STRIDE[1,3]]}
  z{InputAliases[STRIDE[2,3]]}
}
```

Strides can be overridden by specifying additional starts.

```
% Example of x, y, z tuple. User can provide x,y,z tupes up to index 9, after which as many a,b,c tuples are allowed
data {
  x{InputAliases[STRIDE[0,3]]}
  y{InputAliases[STRIDE[1,3]]}
  z{InputAliases[STRIDE[2,3]]}
  a{InputAliases[STRIDE[10,3]]}
  b{InputAliases[STRIDE[11,3]]}
  c{InputAliases[STRIDE[12,3]]}
}
```

### Sections
Sections allow for separating data via a visual delimiter, `/`. Section aliasing allows for naming the values in a given section using zero-based index annotated as 's_INDEX' in the `InputAliases` array.

```
% Example of strided data definition
data {
  radius{InputAliases['s_0']}
  material{InputAliases['s_1']}
  density{InputAliases['s_2']}
}
```
